# Operating Systems

## Introduction

This repository represents a series of projects and reports created by myself to facilitate my learning and understanding of operating systems.

The content of this repository is focused on UNIX based operating systems, and all of the code was developed using Ubuntu.

My primary learning resources were: 
- [Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/)
- [KTH course ID1206](https://www.kth.se/student/kurser/kurs/ID1206?l=en)

### Processes

The process is the major OS abstraction of a running program.

The OS uses the process's API to manage its processes:

Process API:    
- Create: OS must be able to create new processes
- Destroy: Forcefully be able to destroy a process 
- Wait: It is useful to wait for a process to stop running
- Miscellaneous Control: E.g suspend process
- Status: Get status information on the running of a process

### Virtual memory

### Concurrency

### File systems
