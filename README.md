# Operating Systems

## Introduction

This repository represents a series of projects and reports created by myself to facilitate my learning and understanding of operating systems.

The content of this repository is focused on UNIX based operating systems, and all of the code was developed using Ubuntu.

My primary learning resources were: 
- [Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/)
- [KTH course ID1206](https://www.kth.se/student/kurser/kurs/ID1206?l=en)

## Four easy pieces

The repository is divided into four seperate chapters. Below I have summarised my notes for these topics and included references to the related code. 

### Processes

### Virtual memory

### Concurrency

### File systems
